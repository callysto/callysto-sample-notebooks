    "\n",
    "This will only serve as a brief introduction to mathematical typesetting with latex as a full guide could take a few notebooks on its own. However, most of these commands are easy to find if you need to do something special. The basics are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To put a variable in-line, surround it in dollar signs like so: `$variable$`.\n",
    "1. To typeset an equation, surround it (on a new line) in double dollar signs: `$$equation$$`\n",
    "1. you could also use this syntax\n",
    "   ```latex\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "       equation\n",
    "   \\end{equation}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "1. Special symbols start with a backslash (`\\`). For example, the greek letter $\\alpha$ would be called like this `$\\alpha$`. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fractions can be typeset with `\\frac{numerator}{denominator}`\n",
    "1. Square roots are `\\sqrt{stuff inside square root}`\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the cell below to markdown format and run it to see some of these in action.\n"

[here](http://tug.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf) is a link to a comprehensive symbol list, and the command you have to call to render it. Of course, sometimes a Google search is faster. \n",
