    "\n",
    "In the event that you would like to add your own details or questions to a notebook, adding a narrative or \"Markdown\" cell in a Jupyter notebook is straight forward. Think of a markdown cell as analogous to a Microsoft Word document.  Using these cells you can customize the assignment/learning outcomes to your liking on-the-fly. In essence, you have complete control over the lesson right at your fingertips. Here's how to create/edit a Markdown cell:\n",
    "1. Adding a new Markdown Cell\n",
    "    - Click the cell above where you would like to insert text.\n",
    "    - In the top menu, click the '**<span style=\"font-size:larger;\">+</span>**' button.\n",

    "    - Begin typing, press `Ctrl + Enter` to render text into a stylized form.\n",
    "2. Editing an Existing Markdown Cell\n",
    "    - Simply double click on the markdown cell you wish to edit, and begin editing once the cell changes to its \"raw text\" input format.\n",

    "# Basic Markdown Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is quite versatile and supports titles, italic and bold fonts, itemized lists, hyperlinks, images, tables, etc... In fact, every non-code cell in this presentation was created using Markdown! A few of the basic markdown commands are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Titles\n",
    "    - Title text is rendered with a pound sign (`#`) at the beginning of a line, followed by a space and the text you wish to turn into a title/header. For example, `# This is a title` would create a title at any location within your cell. and \n",
    "    - Adding additional pound signs (example: `### Smaller title or heading`) creates different headings. \n",
    "- Italics\n",
    "    - _Italics_ are done by surrounding a word with underscores (`_`). For example `_this would be italics_` would render in italics.\n",
    "- Bold \n",
    "    - **Bold** lettering is done with double asterisks (`**`). For example, `**bold choice**` would render as bold text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "    - Lists can be generated simply by starting a new line and typing `1.` will start a list. Subsequent items can simply be started with a dash `-`, and the markdown will take care of the numbering for you.\n",
    "    - You can also make sub-items by starting a new line within your list, and pressing `Tab`, then either using dashes for points, or starting with `1.` or `A.` for sublist items. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Raw text\n",
    "    - Raw text, or text which ignores any of the style commands can be rendered using an open comma ( \\`). For example \\` sentence \\` would render as `sentence`, and would escape any and all other markdown commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Math\n",
    "    - Markdown also supports Latex style equations. For a variable x, you can render it in-line by surrounding it like so: `$x$` which renders as $x$. if you want to render an equation proper, you can do it either like\n",
    "    ```$$ f(x) = x^2 $$``` or \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f(x) = x^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
