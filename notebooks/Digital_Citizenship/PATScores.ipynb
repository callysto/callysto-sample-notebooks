    "Every year, the province of Alberta runs standardized testing for grades 6 and 9 for primary courses under the blanket identifier of Provincial Achievement Tests in order to assess how well the students preform. The results of these test are open source and readily downloaded from the Alberta Education website. In this notebook we're going to download and manipulate the data direct from Alberta education, and see if we can easily identify under and over performing school districts. Time permitting, we might even toss these onto a map using another open data set from Alberta education which contains the addresses of every school in Alberta. Using this data in combination with the provincial testing scores, we will likely be able to easily identify which school districts/schools are performing best and worst.  \n",

What we'll then have is the performance of each district against the provincial average in terms of test scores for each ear and subject, as well as a graph of how those test scores were affected by differences in _total_ funding. In order to do that, we plot the density of funding and performance grades for the entire province, and then fit a line to it in order to judge positive/negative coorelation between funding and grade performance.

In the small chance those residuals are normally distributed, the line of best fit can be used for extrapolation. However, if they are not, the line of best fit -at best- represents approximate correlation between student performance and funding. \n",

That said, correlation does not depend on causation, and there are significant outliers from the actual cluster."
