Sure enough, we find Scrooge, the main character of *A Christmas Carol*, right at the top, followed by a few other main characters in the top 20. So it's not just Shakespeare who likes to mention his main character's name a lot. Perhaps it's more common.\n",

With a few changes you could even run this on news articles or any other text you could get your hands on.\n",

    "One really easy thing to do is simply add more choices to your selector. Feel free to try this out on your own selection of Gutenberg texts. Once you find the right **EBook-No.**, just add it to the list of `choices`. Remember, you'll have to rerun the step above that crunches the noun phrases and stores them as well before rerunning the last step that makes our selector. "
