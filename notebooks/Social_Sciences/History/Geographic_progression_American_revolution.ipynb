    "Latitude lines measure how far north or south of the equator something is. The equator is defined as the starting point for measuring latitude - that's why it is marked as 0 degrees latitude. The North Pole is listed at 90 degrees, and the South Pole is listed at -90 degrees. The more \"degrees latitude\" a location is, the further away it is from the equator. For example, 50 degrees latitude is further from the equator than 20 degrees latitude is. Depending on if a location is above or below the equator, they are listed as \"degrees North\" or \"degrees South\", and are given a matching positive (+) or negative (-) symbol. \n",

    "Each degree of latitude is approximately 111 kilometers apart (69 miles), although there is some variation as the Earth is not perfectly round. The globe below has the parallels drawn on it. Feel free to spin the globe and zoom in or out on any location. Parallels located south of the Equator are orange, and this part of the Earth is called the Southern Hemisphere. Conversely, parallels located north to the Equator are blue, and this part of the Earth is called the Northern Hemisphere.\n"

The Prime Meridian line runs through the British Royal Observatory in Greenwich England, from the North Pole to the South Pole. As the vertical starting point for longitude, the Prime Meridian is defined as 0 degrees longitude. Interestingly, for many years, each country had its own prime meridian. In 1884, a group of scientists, navigators, and business owners made Greenwich, England, the official worldwide Prime Meridian.\n",

Longitude lines that are **east** of the prime meridian are positive (+), and lines that are **west** of the Prime Meridian are negative (-).
