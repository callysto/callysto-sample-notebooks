    "# Open Data Tutorial 3: Meteorite Landings and Falls\n",
    "\n",
    "In this third installment of our working with open data tutorial series we will be working with another interesting data set which contains the year and location of all recorded meteorite falls until the year 2013. This is an open data set, and is hosted at [this github repository](https://github.com/fleiser/Meteorite-landings/blob/master/Meteorite_Landings.csv). This repository also contains an interesting analysis of this data set as well with many more colorful figures, and interested readers are invited to explore that analysis as well. However, we note that the analysis on that page was _not_ meant to be a tutorial, and it may be difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with Python. \n",

    "However, as this is the third installment in the tutorial series, let's continue with our traditional first step and import the required libraries. You'll notice this time we're using a few more than we have in the past. Not to worry however, as for the most part their just extra tools to make some visualizations a little more exciting. We have entered comments as to what each library is for, and we will explain what we're using them for when they come up in the tutorial. "
