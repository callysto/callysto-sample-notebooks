    "\n",
    "In this third installment of our working with open data tutorial series we will be working with another interesting data set which contains the year and location of all recorded meteorite falls until the year 2013. This is an open data set, and is hosted at [this github repository](https://github.com/fleiser/Meteorite-landings/blob/master/Meteorite_Landings.csv). This repository also contains an interesting analysis of this data set as well with many more colorful figures, and interested readers are invited to explore that analysis as well. However, we note that the analysis on that page was _not_ meant to be a tutorial, and it may be difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with Python. \n",

We have entered comments as to what each library is for, and we will explain what we're using them for when they come up in the tutorial. "

Finally we also worked through how one might go about exploring other aspects of that data with a classic approach of creating a histogram. In doing so, we demonstrated how you might go about manipulating that data with both logarithmic transformations, and normalization in order to compare data sets of different sizes. The skills we have demonstrated here are ubiquitous to almost any other open-data related project, and can be applied in other analysis of your own.  "
