    "Despite the many angles available to see the meteor, it was never found? Why is that. Well, that gets us to the point of semantics. This meteor was the result of an asteroid approximately 20 meters in width with a mass of greater than 10000 tonnes. However, only about 1000 kg of the meteor to date have been recovered. As a result, this meteor is classified as \"fell\" instead of found, as well its mass is approximately what has been recovered.\n",

    "In this notebook we demonstrated how you might go about working with your data set in order to start to tease out more interesting information hidden within a data set. More importantly, we went through the steps to create a histogram and covered many potential problems you may encounter in doing so. We covered some common errors and more subtle problems when working with a data set like this with a large spread in values, and some potential solutions to those problems. We also covered how some interesting trends in data may have perfectly reasonable explanations that are less exciting than the data may lead us to believe. It is our hope that this tutorial series has left you feeling more confident when it comes to working with open data in Jupyter notebooks."
