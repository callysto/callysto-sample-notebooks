    "As the availability and quality of open data (or data that is freely available to the public) is increasing at an astonishing rate, having the skills to work with and analyze data is becoming more and more important. In this notebook series we will walk you through the basics of working with open data using a Jupyter notebook, as well as some of the first steps you can take in terms of data exploration and visualizations. As these are meant to be introductory notebooks for someone who may not have seen any code or a Jupyter notebook before, we will walk through each step involved in detail and keep our analysis at a fairly high level. Of course, we will also show how a high level analysis can also lead to interesting conclusions or realizations.\n",

    "# Bringing Open Data Into Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to load open data into Jupyter is using a Python package called pandas. Pandas is a free and open source library for Python that allows you to manipulate and analyze almost any data you manage to import easily and quickly. It can load CSV files, spreadsheets, text files, and even tables directly from webpages (although, sometimes those tables require a little more processing). In essence, you can think of the pandas library as \"Excel on steroids\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first demonstration, we will walk you through the process of downloading, manipulating, and visualizing an open data set directly from an open data portal. We'll be using this website: [data.opendatasoft.com](https://data.opendatasoft.com). In particular we will be using a rather large data set of vehicle fuel economy available at [this link](https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-vehicle-fuel-economy-data-1984-2017%40kapsarc/table/?disjunctive.make&disjunctive.model&sort=-year). If you travel to that page, you should see a data set that looks like the picture below.\n",

    "If you click the link beside your desired file format, you could download that directly to your computer. However, as we're working on the hub, rather than downloading it to our computer then re-uploading it to the hub, we're going to get this notebook to download that data directly from the site. To do that, if you right click on the link besides the CSV file and click \"Copy Link Address\" you'll get the path to the actual data file. We will be using this link to download the car data directly into Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can download that data we have a few book keeping items to take care of. First, we need to import the pandas library and set our environment up to place any graphs or visualizations we make directly into the notebook. This is done in the cell below. "

    "In this notebook we demonstrated how you can download a open data set directly from the Internet into a Jupyter notebook and start to explore the data. We went through how to do some basic filtering of our data set using `pandas` as well as how to create plots plots easily and effectively from the data without performing any complex manipulations to the data itself. While we did not learn any interesting conclusions in this analysis, this represents a first initial step in data exploration. In part two of this notebook, we will go over the basics of data aggregation in order to discover more exciting and interesting trends hiding in this data set. Hopefully in part two, we can start to tease more interesting trends out of this data set."
